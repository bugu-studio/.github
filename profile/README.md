### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

[ä¸­æ–‡](https://github.com/bugu-studio/.github/blob/main/profile/README_ZH.md)

We are trying to explore:

- A galgame framework that can generate UI and voice through lastest AI, and the galgame games it makes.

- An open-world wuxia game, a role-playing game with many complex worldviews such as ecosystems and financial systems.

In addition to these we will continue to do some demos, because

> The first ten computer games you made in your life were crap, so done them early

If you are interested please contact us :)
